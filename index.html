    <p>The human circulatory system is a complex network responsible for the transportation of blood, nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. At its core, the heart pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body via arteries and returns deoxygenated blood back to the lungs through veins. This vital system ensures that every cell receives the necessary substances to function effectively while removing metabolic wastes. The intricate arrangement of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's homeostasis and overall health.
