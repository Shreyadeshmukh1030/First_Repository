    <h1>Human Respiratory system</h1>
    <p>The human respiratory system is essential for gas exchange, allowing us to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. The process starts with the inhalation of air through the nose or mouth, which then travels down the trachea and into the bronchi, branching into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. These bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is expelled from the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles aid in breathing by expanding and contracting the chest cavity. This system not only provides oxygen to the body's tissues but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the acid-base balance of the blood.</p>
